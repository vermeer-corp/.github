# To use:
# The following needs to be configured for this template to work properly in
#   production:
#   Line 32 - name: Workflow name which appears under "Workflows" in the repo's
#     Actions tab.
#   Line 44 - base_branch: Name of the default branch to compare changed files
#     to.
#   Line 48 - branches: Name of the default branch, or target branch(es) for
#     pull requests, for this repository.
#   Line 58 - version: The version of MATLAB the models are saved in.
#   Line 59 - project: The name of the MATLAB project to run tests for.
#   Line 60 - required_labels: A list of runner labels required to run project
#     tests other than ["self-hosted", "Windows", "matlab"]. This property is
#     not required and can be removed if the default labels are enough to run
#     project tests.
#   Line 61 - timeout_minutes: Maximum time a run tests job is allowed to run
#     before the job gives up.
#   Line 62 - run_cmd: Custom MATLAB command to run project tests. This input
#     element is optional and if undefined, the default eng-vme-actions MATLAB
#     command to run project tests will be ran.
#   Line 63 - status_check: True to use this workflow as a Status Check. This
#     input is optional and defaults to `true` if undefined.
