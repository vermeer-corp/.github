# To use:
# The following needs to be configured for this starter workflow to work
#   properly in production:
#   Line 23 - name: Workflow name which appears under "Workflows" in the repo's
#     Actions tab.
#   Line 30 - name: Name of the base branch for PRs that will trigger this
#     workflow. Normally this is just the default branch, but more can be
#     defined.
#   Line 34 - name: Job name which appears under the workflow.
#
# Notes:
# 1. Save this file in a ".github/workflows" directory in the root of the
#   repository.
# 2. Make sure to change this file extension to yml and give it a good name.
# 3. To deploy documentation in a repository to TLDR/TechDocs, there must exist
#   a valid "mkdocs.yml" in the repository's root and a valid
#   "tldr/catalog-info.yaml" file.
# 4. Refer to https://tldr.vermeer.com/docs/default/Component/pt-backstage/ for
#   more information on IT's TLDR and TechDocs system.
# 5. Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions for more
#   information about GitHub Actions.
