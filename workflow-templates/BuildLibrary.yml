#   Line 27 - name: Workflow name which appears under "Workflows" in the repo's
#     Actions tab.
#   Line 48 - version: The version of MATLAB the library is saved in.
#   Line 49 - project: The name of the MATLAB project for the library to build.
#   Line 50 - required_labels: A list of runner labels required to build the
#     library other than ["self-hosted", "Windows", "matlab"]. This property is
#     not required and can be removed if the default labels are enough to build
#     the library.
#   Line 51 - timeout_minutes: Maximum time a library build job is allowed to
#     run before the job gives up.
#   Line 52 - run_cmd: Custom MATLAB command to run to build a library. This
#     input element is optional and if undefined, the default eng-vme-actions
#     MATLAB command to build a library will be ran.
#   Line 53 - status_check: True to use this workflow as a Status Check. This
#     input is optional and defaults to `true` if undefined.
