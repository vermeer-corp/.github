# Notes:
# 1. Make sure to give this file a good name.
# 2. All paths defined are relative to the root of the repository.
# 3. For models that do not generate binaries (CodeGen only models), leave the
#   binary path blank.
# 4. Definitions under jobs/BuildModels/strategy/matrix/include (lines 57 - 60)
#   are designed to be copied for every controller that needs to be built.
# 5. Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions for more
