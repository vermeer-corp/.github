# To use:
# The following needs to be configured for this starter workflow to work
#   properly in production:
#   Line 35 - name: Workflow name which appears under "Workflows" in the repo's
#     Actions tab.
#   Line 59 - version: The version of MATLAB the project is saved in.
#   Line 60 - root_project: The name of the MATLAB project containing the
#     project to export.
#   Line 61 - export_project: Name of the MATLAB sub-project of `root_project`
#     to export.
#   Line 62 - required_labels: A list of runner labels required to export the
#     project other than ["self-hosted", "Windows", "matlab"]. This property is
#     not required and can be removed if the default labels are enough to export
#     the project.
#   Line 63 - timeout_minutes: Maximum time a project export job is allowed to
#     run before the job gives up. Defaults to `10` if undefined.
#   Line 64 - run_cmd: Custom MATLAB command to run to export a Simulink
#     project. This input element is optional and if undefined, the default
#     eng-vme-actions MATLAB command to export a MATLAB project will be ran.
#   Line 65 - status_check: True to use this workflow as a Status Check. This
#     input is optional and defaults to `true` if undefined.
#   Line 66: export_profile: Default name of the profile to export the project
#     with. See
#     https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.project.project.export.html#mw_4da5d920-ce4a-4e92-bdb8-65485c22c9bb.

# Notes:
# 1. This workflow will fail if exporting a project not saved in MATLAB 2023a or
#   later.
# 2. Save this file in a ".github/workflows" directory in the root of the
#   repository.
# 3. Make sure to change this file extension to yml and give it a good name.
# 4. Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions for more
