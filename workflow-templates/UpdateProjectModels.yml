# To use:
# The following needs to be configured for this starter workflow to work
#   properly in production:
#   Line 32 - name: Workflow name which appears under "Workflows" in the repo's
#     Actions tab.
#   Line 45 - base_branch: Name of the default branch to compare changed files
#     to.
#   Line 51 - branches: Name of the default branch, or target branch(es) for
#     pull requests, for this repository.
#   Line 62 - version: The version of MATLAB the models are saved in.
#   Line 63 - project: Name of MATLAB project to update models for.
#   Line 64 - required_labels: A list of runner labels required to update
#     project models other than ["self-hosted", "Windows", "matlab"]. This
#     property is not required and can be removed if the default labels are
#     enough to update project models.
#   Line 65 - timeout_minutes: Maximum time an update project models job is
#     allowed to run before the job gives up.
#   Line 66 - run_cmd: Custom MATLAB command to update project models. This
#     input element is optional and if undefined, the default eng-vme-actions
#     MATLAB command to update project models will be ran.
#   Line 67 - status_check: True to use this workflow as a Status Check. This
#     input is optional and defaults to `true` if undefined.
